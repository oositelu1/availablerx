# Deploy DocumentTracker to Netlify

Since DocumentTracker has a backend (Express server), we need to use a different approach. Here are better alternatives:

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel supports both frontend and backend:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/fisayoositelu/Downloads/DocumentTracker
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts (create account if needed)

## Option 2: Deploy to Render (Full Backend Support)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub account (or use manual deploy)
5. Use these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Environment Variables: Add your DATABASE_URL from Neon

## Option 3: Deploy to Railway (Easiest)

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo" or "Deploy from Local"
4. Add your DATABASE_URL as environment variable
5. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and deploy

## Option 4: Use Replit (Simplest for Beginners)

1. Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Create account
3. Click "Create Repl" → "Import from GitHub"
4. Or upload your DocumentTracker folder
5. Click "Run" - it handles everything!

## Why Not Netlify?

Netlify is for static sites only. DocumentTracker needs:
- Express.js server (backend)
- Database connections
- File processing
- Real-time features

These require a full server, not just static hosting.

## Quick Deploy to Replit (Recommended for You)

Since localhost isn't working on your Mac, Replit is perfect:

1. Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Sign up (free)
3. Click "Create Repl"
4. Choose "Node.js" template
5. Upload your DocumentTracker files
6. Add your DATABASE_URL to Secrets
7. Click "Run"
8. Your app will be live at: `https://documenttracker.YOUR-USERNAME.repl.co`

No localhost issues, no firewall problems - it just works!
