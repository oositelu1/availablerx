Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: T3 Transaction Management Platform (DSCSA)

________________


1. Purpose
Design and deliver a compliant, user-friendly platform to enable T3 compliance under DSCSA, allowing supply chain partners (suppliers, distributors, pharmacies) to generate, exchange, and archive Transaction Information (TI), Transaction History (TH), and Transaction Statements (TS) in accordance with FDA and GS1 standards.
________________


2. Scope
In Scope:
* Structured creation and storage of TI, TH, and TS per shipment
* Support for EPCIS 1.2 and 2.0 standards (starting with 1.2)
* T3 exchange via AS2, HTTPS, or downloadable URL
* Simple visual interface for T3 chain-of-custody and audit
________________


3. Personas
* Distributor Operator – sends/receives T3 with each shipment
* Pharmacy Receiver – downloads T3, verifies authenticity
* Compliance Officer – audits historical T3 data for inspection
* 3PL / Virtual Manufacturer – needs to generate T3 for clients
