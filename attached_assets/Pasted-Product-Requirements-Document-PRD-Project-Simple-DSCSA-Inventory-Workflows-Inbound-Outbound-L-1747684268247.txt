Product Requirements Document (PRD)Project: Simple DSCSA Inventory Workflows (Inbound + Outbound + Ledger)Version: 1.0Date: 12 May 2025

1. Purpose

Introduce intuitive inbound and outbound product workflows to support product receiving and product shipping at the serial number level, while keeping an accurate inventory ledger. These workflows must remain simple, frictionless, and suitable for non-technical pharmaceutical distributors.

2. Scope

In Scope:

Inbound (Product Receiving) Workflow

Outbound (Product Shipping) Workflow

Serial-level validation against EPCIS data

Inventory ledger to track available stock

Out of Scope:

Full WMS (warehouse management system) capabilities

Complex user roles, pick/pack/ship logistics

API integrations with ERPs (for now)

3. Target Users

Pharmaceutical Distributors (primary and secondary)

Pharmacies or Clinic Receiving Clerks

Warehouse Managers

These users prefer mobile-first, low-friction tools to manage DSCSA compliance and inventory accuracy.
