Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Title:
EPCIS-Enabled Order Lifecycle & Inventory Management System
________________


1. Objective
To build a DSCSA-compliant system that:
* Links EPCIS files with POs/SOs

* Manages serialized inventory in real time

* Enables partner management with GLNs and license tracking

* Supports both ERP-integrated and standalone workflows

* Provides scanning-based reconciliation of physical drugs vs EPCIS

* Creates a defensible audit trail for compliance

________________


2. Stakeholders
   * Pharmaceutical Distributors

   * Warehouse Staff

   * Regulatory & Compliance Officers

   * IT/ERP Integration Teams

________________


3. Core Functional Modules
3.1 Purchase Order (PO) Management
      * Create and manage purchase orders manually or via ERP integration

      * Store PO metadata: PO Number, Supplier, Order Date, Expected Ship Date, Product List

      * Associate inbound EPCIS files with an existing PO

      * Fallback logic for matching EPCIS to PO if PO # is missing:

         * GTIN/product match + supplier + delivery window

         * Manual override to link PO

3.2 Sales Order (SO) Management
            * Create and manage outbound sales orders

            * Store SO metadata: SO Number, Customer, Product List, Serial Quantities, Ship Date

            * Link SO to EPCIS generation and outbound shipments

            * Verify serials being picked match inventory before EPCIS generation

3.3 Serialized Inventory Engine
               * Inbound: When EPCIS file is received and verified, ingest GTIN + Serial + Lot + Exp Date and update inventory

               * Outbound: When SO is created and items scanned, subtract serials from inventory

               * Track inventory at unit level using serials

               * Support filtering and inventory queries by product, serial, lot, supplier, or customer

3.4 EPCIS File Handling (Inbound/Outbound)
                  * Accept and parse EPCIS 1.2 XML files

                  * Extract: GTIN, Serial, Lot, Exp Date, Event Time, bizStep, Disposition, bizTransactionList (PO), source/destination GLNs

                  * Link inbound files to PO, outbound files to SO

                  * Display full parsed EPCIS data for user validation

                  * Flag mismatches between EPCIS and system records

3.5 QR Code Scanning & Reconciliation
                     * Mobile or desktop scanner interface

                     * Parse GS1 2D DataMatrix codes to extract:

                        * GTIN (01), Serial (21), Lot (10), Exp Date (17)

                           * Compare scan result to EPCIS + inventory records

                           * Show PASS/FAIL validation result and mismatch reasons

                           * Write result to compliance log

3.6 Trading Partner Management
                              * Create and manage trading partners (customers and suppliers)

                              * Support multiple ship-from and ship-to addresses per partner

                              * Track GLN, license expiration dates, state licensing, and compliance flags

                              * Associate EPCIS source/destination GLNs with partner records

3.7 ERP/Integration Hooks (Optional)
                                 * Allow integration with SAP or other ERP systems to import/export:

                                    * POs and SOs

                                    * Inventory updates

                                    * Trading partner data

                                       * REST API endpoints and flat file support

3.8 Audit Trail & Compliance Logging
                                          * Log every:

                                             * EPCIS file received/sent

                                             * Scan operation (with scan data and result)

                                             * PO/SO creation and linkage

                                             * Inventory adjustments

                                                * Searchable and exportable audit logs (CSV, PDF)

                                                * Retain logs for minimum 6 years
